             Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised.
             <br>
             Successful singing is important because it builds self-confidence, promotes self-esteem, always engages the emotions, promotes social inclusion, supports social skill development, and enables young people of different ages and abilities to come together successfully to create something special in the arts.
             <br>
             Thomas Edison was one of the first people to record sound. Contrary to popular belief the first recording was by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville who was a French printer and book salesman who invented the phonautograph.
